# Stop using the Mouse

# The XCode License

## Agree To It

XCode is an application that lets you build iOS applications. It also provides a lot of  tools for building all sorts of other applications.

- Open Spotlight (⌘ Space), type `terminal` and press Return
- In the Terminal window that pops up, type the following: `sudo xcodebuild -license`
- It will ask for your password (the one you log into your computer with)
- Press `q` to jump to the end of the license
- Type `agree` and press return to agree to the license

# sudo WTF?

`sudo` lets you run commands as another user. By default that user is `root`, which has access too all commands and files on the system.

---

# Use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

## To easily install stuff

While you are developing software you will likely need to install a number of tools, frameworks and applications. The easiest way to do this is to use a package manager.

- Open Spotlight (⌘ Space), type `terminal` and press Return
- In the Terminal window that pops up, type the following: 

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

---

# Keep Homebrew Happy

Do this semi-regularly:

- Keep Homebrew up to date: `brew update`
- Keep Homebrew healthy: `brew doctor`
  - This may give you some information to act on, which you should
- Keep Homebrew slim: `brew cleanup`

---

# Use iTerm2

## And install it using Homebrew

- In your Terminal window type `brew cask install iterm2`
- Then use Spotlight to start `iterm`

---

# Stop using the Mouse

## To resize windows

Use [ShiftIt](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt) to move and resize windows using the keyboard.

```sh
brew cask install shiftit
```

Then use Spotlight to start ShiftIt.

---

# Giving ShiftIt Permissions

ShiftIt needs permission to control your computer. Let's give it that permission.

1. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility
1. Click the lock to make changes (bottom-left corner) and enter your password
1. In the right-hand pane called "Allow the apps below to control your computer." and check "ShiftIt"
1. Start ShiftIt, it should work without any issue.
